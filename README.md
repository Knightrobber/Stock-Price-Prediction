# Stock-Price-Prediction

Stock market forecasting is a challenging research activity and in this paper, we perform technical analysis on historical stock market data to predict future prices using machine learning and deep learning techniques. We aim to perform and compare different machine learning algorithms and techniques and their accuracy in successfully predicting stock prices. We use the simple moving averages technique, kNN regression and finally LSTM RNNs to analyse the stock time series data by implementing them in Python code and discussing them theoretically.
